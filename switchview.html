          “Design education not only teaches its technical and historical canon,
          or how to design, but more importantly teaches students how to be
          designers in society and in relation to capital,” writes designer
          <a href="http://jacoblindgren.com/">Jacob Lindgren.</a>
          “A school becomes a factory producing designers, one that, in keeping
          with the principles of ‘good design,’ turns them into efficient and
          interchangeable parts ready to hit the market.” In a new essay,
          Lindgren proposes models that may help us undo this factory setting of
          graphic design.

          In his book of essays,
          <em>The Shape of Things,</em>
          Czech philosopher and media critic Vilém Flusser argues that factories
          are decreasingly places where goods are produced and increasingly
          places where new kinds of humans are produced. Flusser viewed
          factories as the primary vessels and sites for agendas of progress and
          ideology, ones that instead of manufacturing solely goods also
          produced new kinds of subjects, writing that “human history is the
          history of manufacturing and everything else is mere footnotes.”

          <!-- as of now the superscripts don't actually link to anything - they are supposed 
              to link to the bottom of the page where the footnotes are but I was not sure how to do that -->

          <sup><a href="#footnote1" id="insidefootnote1">1</a></sup>
          In an article titled “The Critical Crisis of Science,” Flusser
          describes a similar tautology: “Science has become automated and has
          transformed scientists into its own tools.”
          <sup><a href="#footnote2" id="insidefootnote2">2</a></sup>
          For Flusser, learning was analogous to manufacturing: both being
          processes which are based on acquiring, producing and passing on—or
          “turning”—information. “It becomes apparent that the factory is
          nothing but an applied school and the school nothing but a factory for
          the acquisition of information.”
          <sup><a href="#footnote3" id="insidefootnote3">3</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
          These insights shed light on design education today. Design education
          not only teaches its technical and historical canon, or how
          <em>to</em>
          design, but more importantly teaches students how
          <em>to be</em>
          designers in society and in relation to capital. A school becomes a
          factory producing designers, one that, in keeping with the principles
          of “good design,” turns them into efficient and interchangeable parts
          ready to hit the market. Like a spinning ouroboros—a snake swallowing
          its own tail—educational institutions pursue what the market requires
          (a response to capital’s demand for cheap, standardized, and
          predictable parts), molding future designers into interchangeable
          units. To what extent has this cycle, an entanglement of design and
          industry, come to be considered graphic design’s “factory settings”—a
          kind of default, inherent, and out of the box approach to how its
          practice, pedagogy, and history have formed and are enacted?
        </p>

        <p>
          Graphic design is a practice inherently defined by its relationship to
          large-scale production and industry. It was closely intertwined with
          industrial production beginning with the Arts & Crafts movement—one of
          the earliest manifestations of the design academy, despite William
          Morris’
          <a
            href="https://infed.org/william-morris-thoughts-on-education-under-capitalism/"
          >
            reservations
          </a>

          on the matter—and its master-apprentice educational model. Walter
          Gropius’ Bauhaus—a studio-workshop model (currently celebrating its
          centenary)—soon followed with its foundational training. Building from
          the Deutscher Werkbund, an all-encompassing union of design and
          industry, the Bauhaus’s educational strategy attempted to unify craft
          with industrial production, its motto being “Art into Industry.”
          <sup><a href="#footnote4" id="insidefootnote4">4</a></sup>
          While the Bauhaus anticipated an industrial revolution capable of
          delivering visions of mass-produced design for social good, most
          artifacts produced by the school were handmade and given the finish of
          a machined good—designers imitated factories. The Bauhaus wasn’t
          inherently different in nature then the factories Flusser wrote about.
          In his
          <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hkw/mark_wigley_lecture">talk</a>
          “The Bauhaus Virus,” Mark Wigley posits that “the explicit agenda of
          Bauhaus [was] to design a new kind of human. It [was] not a place for
          the design of lamps and chairs—but people.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The school changed locations throughout its existence, from Weimar to
          Dessau to Berlin, and directors—from Walter Gropius to Hannes Meyer to
          Mies van der Rohe—and closed in 1933 due to political pressure. The
          school’s instructors and students dispersed throughout the world and
          met varying fates: some would flee to the Soviet Union, Palestine, or
          to the US, while some would be killed. Despite insisting on being
          apolitical (with Gropius having said, “If we admit politics to the
          Bauhaus… it will collapse like a house of cards. I have already
          announced my intention to prevent any and all politics from entering
          the Bauhaus.”),
          <sup><a href="#footnote5" id="insidefootnote5">5</a></sup>
          both before and after its closing some of the Bauhaus’s biggest names
          would collaborate with the state. From 1928 to 1937 Herbert Bayer
          designed posters and publications for Nazi exhibitions and propaganda,
          including leaflets for the Hitler Youth, only ceasing to do so when
          one of his paintings was included in the
          <em>Entartete Kunst</em>
          (Degenerate Art) exhibition in Munich.
          <sup><a href="#footnote6" id="insidefootnote6">6</a></sup>
          Hannes Meyer and several former students worked on urban projects and
          taught in academies for the Soviet Union, including contributing to
          Joseph Stalin’s first five-year plan.

          Bauhaus-trained Arieh Sharon designed the White City in Tel Aviv—a
          project since described as aiding in the city’s controversial
          narrative surrounding the displacement and erasure of Jaffa, a city in
          part destroyed by 1,500 British soldiers in 1936.

          der Rohe unsuccessfully attempted to collaborate on architecture
          projects with the Nazis, including signing a “motion of support for
          Hitler” in 1934 and joining the Reich Chamber of Culture.
          <sup><a href="#footnote9" id="insidefootnote9">9</a></sup>
          It was in part because of the Nazi’s denial to commission him
          projects, not solely their political pressure, that led van der Rohe
          to leave for the US in 1938. Today, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation
          still considers itself “apolitical,” as first declared by Walter
          Gropius, having

          Mies van der Rohe, one of the most widely heralded exemplars of
          post-Bauhaus legacy, emigrated to the US’s Midwest and took on private
          commissions for corporations, property developers, and the wealthy
          elite. His crossing of the Atlantic was made especially possible by
          Philip Johnson, an American modernist architect and good friend of van
          der Rohe who secured him his first American commission.
          <sup><a href="#footnote10" id="insidefootnote10">10</a></sup>
          Johnson was publicly sympathetic to fascism and anti-semitism, and was
          an admitted Nazi—to the extent of being surveilled by the FBI after
          pursuing an armed, fascist uprising in the US after witnessing first
          hand and being inspired by fascists during World War II.
          <sup><a href="#footnote11" id="insidefootnote11">11</a></sup>
          The uprising failed, and despite his involvement with Nazi ideology
          both in Germany and the US and with all his co-conspirators in prison,
          Johnson enrolled as a student in Harvard University’s Graduate School
          of Design. Afterwards he would go on to join the architecture
          department at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, an institution
          conceptualized by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller (the wife of John D.
          Rockefeller, Jr.).
          <sup><a href="#footnote12" id="insidefootnote12">12</a></sup>
          van der Rohe would eventually accept a position as the director at the
          School of Architecture at the Armour Institute (now Illinois Institute
          of Technology) in Chicago, originally named the New Bauhaus when
          founded by Lazlo Maholy-Nagy, a former Bauhaus professor. This new
          Bauhaus was conceived when the Association of Arts and Industries, an
          organization to whose purpose was to further the implementation of
          design in industry, expressed interest in establishing a school via a
          letter of invitation to appoint Walter Gropius as director, who
          instead recommended Maholy-Nagy. The school, still in operation after
          several shake-ups, now prides itself on being the birthplace of
          “design thinking,” or the linking of design “more closely to business
          innovation,” one of the motors behind contemporary design’s deployment
          in venture capital-injected, Silicon Valley initiatives.
          <sup><a href="#footnote13" id="insidefootnote13">13</a></sup>
          That the the marriage of design and business in the pursuit of profit
          and progress be labeled as something as ubiquitous as “thinking” is
          telling as to what extent design is entrenched in industry.

          Originally housed in the mansion of Marshall Field, founder of the
          emblematic and successful department store of the same name, the New
          Bauhaus would eventually encounter financial turmoil and struggled to
          maintain its program afloat, including losing its funding from the
          Association of Arts and Industries. This prompted Maholy-Nagy to found
          his own school, the School of Design in Chicago.
          <sup><a href="#footnote14" id="insidefootnote14">14</a></sup>
          Also susceptible to economic difficulties like its predecessor, it was
          saved from demise when Walter P. Paepcke, president of the Container
          Corporation of America—an organization which would become a revered
          design icon—contributed personal donations and his fundraising efforts
          to keep its doors open, including money from the Rockefeller
          Foundation.
          <sup><a href="#footnote15" id="insidefootnote15">15</a></sup>
          Over the course of its existence a summer course was also held at a
          property near Somonauk, Illinois, made available by Paepcke. Amid
          further financial troubles in 1941, Moholy-Nagy was appointed to the
          Chicago mayor’s personal staff in order to design and employ
          camouflage to hide military personnel and equipment, including an
          eventual plan to attempt at hiding the entire city of Chicago.
          <sup><a href="#footnote16" id="insidefootnote16">16</a></sup>
          He embedded in and prototyped these ideas via the school’s curriculum,
          which Walter Gropius would eventually describe as a “certified school
          for camouflage personnel.”
          <sup><a href="#footnote17" id="insidefootnote17">17</a></sup>
          In 1943, Moholy-Nagy curated a “Camouflage Exhibition” at the School
          of Design featuring the school’s work. Like mussels on a ship’s hull,
          the Bauhaus clung to industry (in this case for the army)—crossing
          oceans on several occasions (both literally in its relocation and less
          tangibly in the export of its ideology globally) and surviving in its
          current state as a result of this bond. Despite its manifestos and
          intentions, the Bauhaus’s modernism would become the face not of
          socialism, communism, or Nazism, but of capitalism, with modernist
          design becoming a powerful tool in the belt of corporations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both historic and contemporary modes of design education are largely
          informed by this pipeline between their institutions and the
          commercial environment designers eventually find themselves working
          in, with graphic design securing its place as a tool almost
          exclusively for industry (as best evidenced in the advertising and
          standards manuals of the time, now reissued as holy tomes). The extent
          to which all these entanglements effect our thinking about and
          perception of design cannot be understated, and the Bauhaus plays a
          pivotal role—for example there is the statistical likelihood, as
          suggested by Mark Wigley, that you are reading this on a device that
          exists as a direct result of the Bauhaus. In 1981, Steve Jobs attended
          the International Design Conference in Aspen (IDCA), an organization
          founded by Container Corporation of America’s Paepcke and whose
          building was designed by Herbert Bayer as essentially a monument to
          the Bauhaus through its architecture, furniture, and signage. The
          IDCA’s first event in 1951 was titled “Design as a Function of
          Management,” in an attempt to garner support from the business
          community, and presently the organization collaborates with the
          American Institute of Graphic Artists (AIGA)—regarded as the largest
          and premier organization for design professionals, with a particular
          focus on educational chapters throughout design schools—to realize its
          conferences. During that visit in 1981 Jobs became infatuated with the
          same design ideology embedded into the institute’s very fabric. When
          returning in 1983 to speak at the same conference in a talk titled “
          <a
            href="https://soundcloud.com/mbtech_1434547055436/talk-by-steven-jobs-idca-1983"
          >
            The Future Isn’t What It Used to Be
          </a>
          ,” Jobs proclaimed his subscription to the Bauhaus way of thinking:
          “What we’re going to do is make the products high-tech, and we’re
          going to package them cleanly so that you know they’re high-tech. We
          will fit them in a small package, and then we can make them beautiful
          and white, just like Braun does with its electronics.” Whether it’s
          through notions of progress, design tied to industry, streamlined
          forms and production methods, or the claim that a global,
          “International Style” is possible (and a good thing), the Bauhaus is
          present in much of the physical and intangible discourse surrounding
          design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Much of contemporary design curriculum is still based on the Bauhaus
          model and its ramifications, including the many offshoots it
          influenced in Chicago, Basel, Zurich, Ulm, and elsewhere. This isn’t
          to suggest that everyone involved in the Bauhaus can be categorized
          under the same umbrella—far from the case, also considering the fact
          that much of the Bauhaus’s historiography
          <a href="https://www.frieze.com/article/women-bauhaus">excludes</a>
          the contributions of its numerous women students, professors, and
          partners of men—but that what is considered to be the “Bauhaus model,”
          regardless of how close it actually adheres to the school’s ideology
          or actions, is the primary model in which contemporary programs are
          rooted. Here it is unimportant what the Bauhaus aimed to be, or the
          way it acted in practice, but instead what it came to symbolize—an
          image designed by the Bauhaus itself. “Whether these ideas were
          actually realized or even consistent is irrelevant here; they endure
          as what the Bauhaus has come to represent.”
          <sup><a href="#footnote18" id="insidefootnote18">18</a></sup>
          Even more encompassing than the Bauhaus’s model, but certainly as a
          result of it, design education and history are completely dominated by
          western principles and hegemony. Exceptions to the reach of both
          exist, but many design educators will recognize the fact that not much
          has fundamentally changed since graphic design education’s inception.
          Compounded by the dismantling of the university’s academic mandate via
          neoliberal austerity, graphic design education, like much of academia,
          is far removed from contemporary social, political, and economic
          urgencies. Assignments which bring client work into the school, or
          invite “practical and professional experience,” condition students
          even further. Having just completed the Bauhaus’s 100-year anniversary
          in 2019, what better time to examine its influence on graphic design
          education?
        </p>

        <p>
          This persistent reinforcement of industry determining the orientation
          of design education, combined with the increasing cost of education
          and burden of student debt, puts designers (and schools) in a position
          to desire, seek out, and reproduce employable skills in their
          practice. In spite of this totalizing picture of design education, one
          wonders how things could be different. How might graphic design
          pedagogy be repositioned to critique rather than uphold the
          ideological structures of capital? With design education as the
          primary site where this ideology is replicated, it presents a ripe
          opportunity to rethink and refine these structures. What would it look
          like to identify and replace the current power structures and
          ideologies embedded in contemporary design practice and pedagogy? What
          tools are available to do so and who gets to decide how they are used?
          The past decade has seen an increase in attempts to answer this
          question, in part by following in the footsteps of the
          <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/00/68470/turning/">
            educational turn
          </a>
          in the arts: the proliferation of biennials, books, and exhibitions on
          the topic of education within graphic design are evidence of this. A
          book I edited which is no exception,
          <em>Extra-curricular</em>
          , takes stock of many of these self-organized efforts in an attempt to
          decouple design pedagogy from its traditional institutional makeup.
          The contributed pieces cover examples of summer schools, workshops,
          curriculums, strategies, theories, fictions, unaccredited programs,
          and many other forms both concrete and speculative. The shared goal of
          these initiatives is to voice dissatisfaction towards, and propose
          alternatives to the inertia of, conventional graphic design pedagogy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Self-organized educational initiatives move closer to alternative
          pedagogies for graphic design while also serving as sites for
          rethinking the practice as one closer to a mode of inquiry then an
          effect of industry. Regardless of the varied approaches, the common
          thread between these efforts is the drive to disturb existing
          educational structures by building underneath, on top of, or adjacent
          to them. Self-organized models shift traditional school environments
          towards acting less like nonplaces—structures built in a way to
          prevent participants from imprinting upon them with their own marks,
          histories, and identities—and more like reflections of the needs and
          desires of whose who learn inside of them. One difficulty encountered
          in most self-organized efforts is the extent to which alternative
          models ever can truly exist outside of the reach of the institutions
          they often counter, and is up for debate. The same institutions
          holding power are unlikely to facilitate the kind of restructuring
          required to change their ways, given that their investments are at
          risk. Typically, self-organized learning and educational models occupy
          blurry areas within and to varying extents outside of these
          institutions. It’s not always possible, or plausible, to exist outside
          of or sever ties with existing structures, and sometimes working in
          this arena requires modeling the very institutions needing un-doing.
          Creating and prototyping these models at scale, instead of through
          outright denial or dismissal of them, is a way of conducting critique
          around and attempting to enact change within the larger structures
          they imitate. Akin to the way architects prepare for a building’s
          construction, small-scale models present opportunities to test out
          sites of possibility, stress, and tensions before a structure’s
          realization.

          An example of this modeling, quite literally, is
          <em>Spinning Triangles: Ignition of a School of Design</em>
          —a project by Savvy Contemporary (in addition to an extensive list of
          organizers, contributors, and collaborators) that aims to “challenge
          and act against the inherent, neocolonial power structures in design
          practices, theory and teaching” by re-staging the founding moment of
          the Bauhaus in an attempt to create an “un-school” in its image.
          <sup><a href="#footnote19" id="insidefootnote19">19</a></sup>
          The result is, among other things, the
          <em>Wohnmaschine</em>
          —a traveling model Bauhaus that serves as a platform and library and
          counterpoint to the full-size Bauhaus. Existing in its image, at
          scale, the model acts as a lens through which participants can examine
          the ways in which the Bauhaus’s legacy manifests, decidedly not only
          in the geopolitical west but elsewhere. The mobile school’s first stop
          was Kinasha, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a location that the
          project cites as being entangled with notions of industry,
          productivity, and progress similarly inherent in the Bauhaus model and
          which our smartphone-modernity relies (via resource extraction). With
          a backdrop of failed but “still active modernist masterplans,” the
          project is inclusionary of design discourse, practices, and narratives
          from the global South—ones which have been systemically excluded (or
          appropriated). The holes in the Earth’s surface dug to extract the
          resources needed for phones—in competition with the holes in the
          atmosphere as perhaps the biggest collectively designed object in the
          last 100 years—must be considered as a facet of the design processes
          which call into existence the designed object itself. For this reason
          design is inherently political, regardless of how it is practiced, as
          evidenced in its ability to condition and affect materials, politics,
          bodies, and ultimately the planet. It’s worth re-examining this
          inherent relation to politics through the lens of the Bauhaus’s
          hegemony on design education and historiography, or any factor
          dictating how material conditions are shaped (let alone one that
          strives to be “apolitical,” a form of being political). By spinning
          triangles, a go-to choice in Bauhaus and modernist visual language,
          new forms emerge—wheels on which models can twist and turn in new
          directions. “Through the gesture of spinning the triangle, flipping
          the hourglass; i.e. setting a seemingly stable, hierarchised form into
          motion, speeding it up, changing its outline, dizzying its content,
          challenging its conception of present, past and future… For this to
          happen, we spin triangles, and flip the hourglass, we reverse
          geographies and turn import-export relations upside down.”

        </p>

        <p>
          This modeling happens inside, outside, detached from, or contingent on
          the larger models it wishes to affect. Take the Parallel School,
          another example, which aims to act as an open environment for art and
          design self-education by creating a nonproprietary network for
          interested individuals to create their own versions, or schools. These
          schools are itinerant and dispersed, not tied to one geographic
          location, and with a changing roster of participants. Since 2009, the
          Parallel School has setup in Cali, Lausanne, Leipzig, Brno, São Paulo,
          Glasgow, Berlin, Paris, London, and Moscow. In
          <em>Extra-Curricular</em>
          , several participants of the Berlin and Brno meetings wrote “LETTER
          TO THE ACADEMY,” a text in which they explain their approach (“…the
          basic situation in which people get together to share their ideas and
          interests, discuss and teach each other and themselves”), express
          their concerns (“dear Academy: What spaces do you offer? How are they
          structured? Can the students take over?”), and provide motivations
          (“we need the common, the occupied, the appropriated, and the lesser
          governed spaces. We need to be aware of the spaces we fulfill and to
          build our own environments and organizations that serve our purposes”)
          for organizing themselves.
          <sup><a href="#footnote21" id="insidefootnote21">21</a></sup>
          While differing from iteration to iteration, the central idea behind
          the project was to experiment with an autonomous environment comprised
          of shared learning, knowledge, and resources. Participants in the
          Berlin school debated whether it made more sense to consider the
          school “diagonal,”
          <sup><a href="#footnote22" id="insidefootnote22">22</a></sup>
          based on the many points in which it intersected with established
          institutions. Whether via using the spaces, resources, and networks of
          an institution or the fact that most participants had either attended
          or were still connected to an institution, it became clear that
          Parallel School could never completely circumvent the structures it
          was critiquing. An absolute separatist approach then appears
          unlikely—critique and change can also take place at varying angles,
          from diagonal to parallel.
        </p>

        <p>
          This line of inquiry—to what extent is it possible to be outside of
          the systems and institutions that enclose us—isn’t new, and was
          perhaps most clearly captured in one of the first films ever recorded:
          <em>Workers Leaving Thee Lumière Factory</em>
          . The film was produced by Louis Lumière, part owner of the industrial
          workplace which features as backdrop. It’s been noted that, true to
          the film’s title, the workers clearly leave the factory, but to what
          extent are they forced to take it along with them? In what ways does
          the factory manage to extend into and inform our lives, ones
          supposedly outside of it? In the post-Fordist system of economic and
          knowledge production that we inhabit is there even a gate through
          which to exit, or have the factory’s walls been extended beyond our
          view? It’s now hardly necessary for the factory to physically enclose
          us. With regards to graphic design—now largely immaterial labor—the
          proliferation of adjunct teaching positions, precarious (freelance)
          work, and a general culture of commodification of the self as
          entrepreneur (or
          <a href="https://networkcultures.org/entreprecariat/">
            entreprecariat
          </a>
          ) make the structures and apparatus through which power manifests ones
          no longer limited to existing within the “factory walls.” (“The real
          school, the real Bauhaus, is not inside the building, but outside.”)
          <sup><a href="#footnote23" id="insidefootnote23">23</a></sup>
          In this way, and in keeping with the school’s desire to flatten
          hierarchies, the Bauhaus students who dispersed throughout the world
          ended up being its biggest teachers, and design practice and
          historiography largely carries their teachings inherent in every
          interaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s as if design education is reproducing the film, playing it in
          reverse, and repeating. Workers leave the school-as-factory through
          the front gates, simply conditioned to re-enter, or re-produce its
          teachings, upon practice. Here Michel Foucault’s “grid of
          intelligibility”—the idea that there is an underlying fabric on which
          society is controlled, maneuvered, and power is imposed—begins to
          resemble the Modernist obsession with grids. Gayatri Chakravorty
          Spivak reminds us of the limitations of these grids: “[But] if these
          lines of making sense of something are laid down in a certain way,
          then you are able to do only those things with that something which
          are possible within and by arrangement of those lines.”
          <sup><a href="#footnote24" id="insidefootnote24">24</a></sup>
          Upon further inspection—perhaps by reading in between the (gridded)
          lines—the supposedly transgressive, experimental ideology ascribed to
          Modernist design begins to more closely resemble a simple service to
          global capital. What would happen if this cycle were to be broken, if
          we shed our imposed grids? As with most questions surrounding power
          and its redistribution, there remains much uncertainty as to what
          could fill this void. A danger inherent in self-organized approaches
          is the unintentional reinforcing of the very same power mechanisms
          they attempt to counter. With the flattening of hierarchies and
          circumvention of regulating bodies, economies of free time, social and
          cultural capital, and unpaid labor all become alternative currencies
          which can take unaccountable and unsustainable forms. Self-organized
          forms of education can reaffirm the very same neoliberal tendencies in
          education they intend to critique by relieving the institution of its
          responsibility to provide for its students and faculty. For this
          reason it’s important for these initiatives to be speculative and
          world-building in nature, but also to be rooted in and cognizant of
          the conditions that structure their range of possibilities.
        </p>

          What should be done? At the very least a closer examination of graphic
          design’s factory settings—both the widely unchallenged, inherited
          models it has come to consider “default” in addition to its reluctance
          to step outside of (or sever from) its relationship to industry, to
          the factory. This reset—or reprogramming, or uninstallation—should
          challenge graphic design practice and education to be untethered from
          their one-way relationships to power and knowledge and might occur in
          parallel or “diagonal” to existing structures. It might be a newly
          imagined curriculum that places emphasis on feminism, decoloniality,
          access to tools, anti-capitalism, ecological sustainability, queer
          praxis, or other positionalities that have been marginalized or erased
          by conventional design pedagogy and history. It shouldn’t, and more
          importantly cannot, happen with existing design conventions entrenched
          in “design thinking,” or new technologies and streamlined solutions,
          but instead through a model for graphic design education which
          questions its hard-coded relationship to capital. If the contemporary
          definition and standardized practice of design and design education
          are over a century old, might it be a good idea to reexamine both in
          an age where ecological disaster, immaterial and precarious labor,
          post-factual politics (often times with design an implicit actor), and
          geopolitical conflict are among the world’s defining challenges?
          Self-organized education presents one tool, among many, which can be
          used to think through and act on these challenges. In order to do so
          we need to leave the factory, potentially by building our own
          school-as-exit. If we can’t leave, or decide to stay, we need to
          <a
            href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/01/may-day-workers-of-the-world-unite-and-take-over-their-factories"

            repurpose its machinery

          and

            organize ourselves
          </a>
          appropriately.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn’t to suggest that the result should be apolitical, or that it
          would simply suffice to get rid of the undesirable facets embedded
          into graphic design practice and historiography. On the
          contrary—design should become decidedly and admittedly political (no
          more “leaving politics out of design”). Rather, in what way can these
          same motivations, material articulations, and intentions—ones informed
          by industry and existing to service capital at the expense of
          destroying bodies and the planet—be reverse engineered and
          reconfigured for completely different ends, such as the
          above-mentioned ones? To end where we began: Vilém Flusser described
          the factory’s mode of production as “turning,” in that manufacturing
          is “turning what is available in the environment to one’s own
          advantage, turning it into something manufactured, turning it over to
          use and thus turning it to account.”
          <sup><a href="#footnote25" id="insidefootnote25">25</a></sup>
          A long-standing mystery surrounding the
          <em>Workings Leaving the Factory</em>
          film is where exactly the workers are headed as they exit through the
          factory’s front gates. (“To a meeting? To the barricades? Or simply
          home?”).
          <sup><a href="#footnote26" id="insidefootnote26">26</a></sup>
          If the school is a factory, and the educational turn allows us to
          examine the conditions of our own manufacturing, or our “turning” as
          Flusser puts it—as we exit, where should we turn?

          The author begins the article by explaining that factories are
          becoming more about producing new kinds of humans rather than new
          kinds of goods. He explains that the process of learning is similar to
          the process of manufacturing. They are both based on acquiring,
          producing, and passing on information. Lindgren continues to describe
          the process of design education today, which consists of learning
          technique, history, and how to design for society and for the purpose
          of capital. Overall, his point of view revolves around the idea that
          design school has become about preparing students for the design
          market and is closely linked to capitalism. Lindgren discusses the
          history of design education, and how it has evolved over the years. He
          mainly focuses on Bauhaus, which he explains began to teach in the
          pursuit of profit.

          The article asks how we can reposition design education today. The
          author provides some good topics of discussion that can reframe what
          it means to be a designer. Design education can focus on “feminism,
          decoloniality, access to tools, anti-capitalism, ecological
          sustainability, queer praxis,” and more. I agree with the author that
          we need to re-evaluate how design is being taught, and what topics are
          discussed in the classroom. It is crucial to discuss how design
          impacts the world we live in, and not only focus on the commercial
          aspect of design. Over time, we have started having these
          conversations as designers, but there is more that needs to be said
          and done.

          I completely agree with the author that the purpose of graphic design
          feels very commercialized, and design education ultimately gives
          students a formula for how to get a job and succeed in whichever
          industry they choose to work in. I think that reframing design
          education to focus on more meaningful topics is important and can help
          students understand their role in society as a designer. But at the
          end of the day, it feels as though most aspiring designers attend
          school to learn this formula, to get a design job, and contribute to
          society. I think part of this has to do with the fact that we must pay
          costly tuition in order to study, so ultimately, we want to ensure our
          studies will lead to success and job opportunities.

          Graphic design is defined as “the art or skill of combining text and
          pictures in advertisements, magazines, or books.” By definition,
          graphic design seems to revolve around promoting commercial goods.
          Maybe we need to reframe the meaning of graphic design altogether. How
          can we properly rebuild the design education model so that school no
          longer functions as a “factory,” and ensure that design is not only in
          the pursuit of capital?
